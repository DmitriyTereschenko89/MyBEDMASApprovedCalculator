Given a string of characters and symbols, calculate the expected result. The string consists of numbers, and the operators:

/  division
+  addition
-  subtraction
\* multiplication
^  power of

As well as the brackets ()
Numbers can be integers or doubles.

Assume the string is of the correct format (no missing brackets, unmatched operators). The format of the string can also have optional whitespace between numbers and symbols, so the following are equivalent:

"3+4*2"
"3 +                             4*   2"
